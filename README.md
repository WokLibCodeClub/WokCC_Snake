# WokCC_Snake

This is a Snake game using Python turtles. It is written in trinket.

### First session: Saturday 3 June 2023

We started building this project at our session on Saturday 3 June 2023.

The starter project is at

For those who weren't at the session but would like to catch up with what we did we have made a video to explain this. The link is

The code as it was at the end of this session can be found here:

### Second session: Saturday 24 June 2023

In the second session we wrote code to make the snake body move along with the snake head, with a Python ```for``` loop with some clever use of the ```range()``` function. We looked at a little Python programme to help work out the correct parameters for ```range()```. The link to this project is:

We used a powerpoint presentation to show how the snake body segments are moved. You can download the presentation here: [Moving Snake Body.pptx](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/WokCC_Snake/blob/main/Moving%20Snake%20Body.pptx)

(When you click on this link look for the Download symbol or button at the top right of the page and click on it to download the file to your computer.)

We also wrote a function to handle the snake eating the food.

There is a video covering what we did at the session for the benefit of anyone who couldn't make it in person. The link is

### Third session: Saturday 1 July 2023

At the end of the second session we left a poser for you to think about. How can we reduce the value of the variable ```delay``` each time the snake eats food but without the value ever becoming negative?

In the third and final session we suggested one way of doing this, and added code to detect if the snake crossed over itself. We displayed the score and coded the updating of the High Score variable.

We will make a video summarising this session and post the link here.
