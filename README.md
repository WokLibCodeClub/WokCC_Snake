### First session: Saturday 3 June 2023

We started building this project at our session on Saturday 3 June 2023.

The starter project is at

For those who weren't at the session but would like to catch up with what we did we have made a video to explain this. The link is

### Second session: Saturday 24 June 2023

In the second session we wrote code to make the snake body move along with the snake head, with a Python ```for``` loop with some clever use of the ```range()``` function. We looked at a little Python programme to help work out the correct parameters for ```range()```. The link to this project is:

We used a powerpoint presentation to show how the snake body segments are moved. You can download the presentation here:

We also wrote a function to handle the snake eating the food.

In the next few days we will make a video covering what we did at the session for the benefit of anyone who couldn't make it in person. The link will appear here.
